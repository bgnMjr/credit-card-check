# credit-card-check
## What does it do?

That includes checking the checksum (Luhnâ€™s Algorithm) and general length of the inputted number.

## Output
It prints AMEX, if it's American Express, or MASTERCARD or VISA or INVALID (if there are any problems).

## Libraries used
This programm uses cs50 library that can be found at [CS50 Library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).

## Academic honesty
### ! IMPORTANT !
If you are in the process of completing your own cs50x course, please do NOT copy/use this solution.
It would go against the principle of academic honesty and would be defeating the purpose of taking the course in the first place.
